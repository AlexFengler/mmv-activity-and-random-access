# MMV Activity Detection and Unsourced Random Access
Matlab simulation of
1. The relaxed ML-algorithm for MIMO activity detection described in [1]. (The ML curve of Figure 2 in [1])
2. The concatenated coding scheme for massive MIMO Unsourced Random Access described in [1], which uses the relaxed ML algorithm
as inner decoder and the outer code of [2]. (Figure 8 in [1])
